Originality 	4/5

Size of project 18/20

Quality of UI 64/80
    DONT USE CAPS
    At times when clicking on LEFT or RIGHT nothing appears to happen
    Why italic? a bit harder to read
    FLANKER - why the odd font?, What is flanker?
    Why exit? have not seen an app that that has a way to kill app
    Alignment is off on devices - Ran on iPhone 7 (same size as 6s) and appwas unusable
Working code 75/75
Quality of code 19/20
    Some inconsistent spacing/formating
